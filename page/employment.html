    <h3>Freelancer Web Developer</h3>
    <p>Self-Employed Web Developer (Nov 2012 - Current)</p>
    
    <!-- Left Coulumn -->
    <div class="layout-6040-left overflow-fix clear-fix">
      As a way to break away from my previous employment history and to show my desire to change careers, I started freelancing my skills in web development. I use the business knowledge I gained from previous jobs to help me run my own part-time business while I further my education. As a developer, I have secured and executed several projects on my own and I have also had the opportunity to collaborate with other developers as well. For example, I worked with the webmaster (Robert Williams) at How Art Thou Café of James Island for two months and taught him how to install and develop a WordPress theme for their website.

    <h3>Anchor Sign, Inc.</h3>
    <p>Logistics Manager (Sept 2006 - Nov 2012)</p>
    
    <!-- Left Coulumn -->
    <div class="layout-6040-left overflow-fix clear-fix">
      At Anchor Sign, my daily tasks consisted mostly of shipping, receiving, and inventory control. An important part of this job was contract negotiations with freight carriers. During my time in this position, I was able to negotiate very large discounts for the company. By the time I left, I had negotiated an increase in less-than-truckload discounts from when I had started by 35%-42% with all major carriers. As a side project, I developed a robust database application, still in use today, that streamlined the shipping process and saved the company 2-3 hours a day.

      In this high-pressure support position, I provided troubleshooting during tournament play.

    <!-- Left Coulumn -->
    <div class="layout-6040-left">
      During my 3+ years at ABC Supply, I worked in practically every capacity in the company. I started as an Inside Sales Rep, quickly moved up to Showroom Coordinator, was put in charge of AR/AP and payroll, and then got experience as an Inventory Specialist and a Purchasing Coordinator. Having worked in so many roles, I learned to handle the logistics side of business, and how to track and handle the company’s finances.

    <!-- Left Coulumn -->
    <div class="layout-6040-left">
      For many years I built thriving sales organizations, mainly selling nutritional supplements for two separate companies. To do this, I created websites and tools that other Independent Distributors in my organization used to sell their products. At the peak of my business, my yearly sales volume was over $1,000,000 spanning 5 countries.
