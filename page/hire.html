  <h1>Why Hire Me</h1>
  
  <h3>A Passion for Creating Solutions</h3>
  
  <p>I like to solve problems. Coming up with solutions that help people – whether clients or coworkers – motivates me on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>For example, while working for Anchor Sign, I noticed that the monthly inventory took an inordinate amount of time to complete. I was sure that the time and energy spent on that task could be better spent elsewhere. I developed a database-centered process that cut down on time from multiple days to several hours. The database was such a success that Anchor Sign is still using it to this day.</p>

  <h3>A Passion for Learning</h3>

  <p>I began developing websites in the mid-1990s, a time when the most technologically advanced development program was Notepad. Since that time, I’ve eagerly learned as much as I could both at school and on my own to build a solid foundation in programming and web design.

  <p>I am a quick learner, and my curiosity often leads me in new directions. I consider education a lifelong pursuit, and I don’t expect I’ll ever stop learning.</p>

  <h3>A Unique Combination of Skills</h3>

  <p>Because I have owned my own company and have experience in many aspects of business (including accounts payable and accounts receivable, payroll, shipping, inventory, and logistics), I know what keeps companies ticking and what matters to their bottom line. That, combined with my experience and knowledge in computer programming and web development equals a unique perspective valuable to any business.</p>
