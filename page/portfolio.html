  <h1>Code is King</h1>

  <p>As quoted by Alex Clark, I’m often asked “What can I do to improve my chances of landing a dream job?” My answer is always the same. “Go home and create an account [on GitHub], start a repository and display your code tonight." So below are a few links to repositories on my GitHub account.</p>

  <h2 class="port"><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Boyd/TechKudo" target="_blank">TechKudo on GitHub</a></h2>

  <p>I learned to build full-stack web apps with Ruby on Rails over a grueling and intensive 12 week program at The Iron Yard. TechKudo was my final final project that I presented on June 20, 2014. TechKudo is a directory of technology companies, where they are located, where to find job openings and kudos from people that know the company.   </p>

  <h2 class="port"><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Boyd/hospital" target="_blank">Hospital on GitHub</a></h2>

  <p>Hospital application for tracking of patient flow as well as multiple hospitals, doctors and medications This application made use of many gems including Devise, CanCan, and Workflow. Javascript, jQuery and AJAX were also used in this app.</p>

  <h2 class="port"><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Boyd/TheIronYard" target="_blank">IronYard on GitHub</a></h2>

  <p>You can also wade through all my code during the first 6 weeks at the Iron Yard. There are many duplicate folders in this repository as we did not learn about branching during this course, but the image below shows the folders with the most pertinent information.</p>

  <h2 class="port"><a href="https://github.com/Brian-Boyd/TheIronYard" target="_blank">Homework Tracker</a></h2>

  <p>One of the projects that I plan to complete is the Student Homework Tracker. This app will keep track of homework submissions. It will have user authentication to control user homework submissions. The design is almost finished as you can see in the screenshot below.</p>

  <h1>Design should be functional</h1>
  
  <p>Having developed dozens of websites over the past 20 years, I know that good web design requires the ability to communicate with customers, the knowledge to create something they want, and the patience to work until it’s just right. My past customers appreciated how my websites were both functional and visually appealing.</p>

  <p>Here are a few examples:</p>

  <p>"If you want a great site, you’ve got to test it. After you’ve worked on a site for even a few weeks, you can’t see it freshly anymore. You know too much. The only way to find out if it really works is to test it."<br />―Steve Krug</p>
