  <p>I was born in Chicago, IL, and spent most of my childhood in the beautiful mountains of West Virginia where I enjoyed hiking, camping, and spending time with friends. I called many places home, from Jacksonville, FL to Brooklyn, NY to Atlanta, GA. I settled in Charleston, SC in 2006 and now live on James Island with my lovely wife Helen and daughter Isabel.</p>

  <p>Spending time with family is the most important thing to me. Together, we enjoy the sand at Folly Beach, playing at the park, riding bicycles, traveling to nowhere in particular, or just relaxing at home.</p>

  <p>Although my score after a round of golf is usually in the triple digits (occasionally dipping in the 2-digit realm), I enjoys the game just as much as any scratch golfer. Indoors, you can sometimes find me playing the game SimCity, as the city-building computer game allows me to sharpen my logic and planning skills. My fascination with computers and technology has led me to pursue a career in that field.</p>

  <p>I traveled all over the globe for business and pleasure, learning about various cultures and meeting people along the way. I'm able to strike up a conversation easily and connect with people I meet. To me, no one is a stranger.</p>
