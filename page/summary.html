  <p>This website is an extension of my traditional résumé. It is a place to showcase my skills and demonstrate the value I would bring to a business looking to hire someone skilled in computer technology and programming.</p>

  <p>I have a passion for learning and for solving problems, two attributes that past employers have greatly valued. I will bring these attributes and skills to my new employer, along with my keen business sense.</p>

  <p>Please look around the site to read more about me, my background, and what I have to offer.</p>

  <p>Please contact me if you think I might be a good fit for your company, or if you have any questions about what you’ve seen on this site. Thank you for your time.</p>
