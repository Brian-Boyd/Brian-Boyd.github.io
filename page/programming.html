  <h1>Programming</h1>
  <!-- /Page Header -->

  <!-- Text Section -->
  <p>Being a successful programmer is about more than knowing a programming language. It’s about having the right mindset. Successful programmers are able to think both large scale – knowing what the end goal of a program is – and small scale – knowing how to get there, step by step. With my background in programming, I’m able to successfully take a program from design through creation to implementation.</p>

  <p>Good programmers are also problem solvers. This is the aspect of programming work that appeals to me most. Although I enjoy programming, I like fixing problems even more.</p>
